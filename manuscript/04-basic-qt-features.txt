# Basic Qt Features

Welcome to your first steps in create graphical applications! In this chapter you will
be introduced to the key basic features of Qt (PyQt) that you will find yourself using
in any applications you create. We will develop a series of small applications,
adding (and removing!) features step-by-step. Use the code given as your guide, and 
feel free to experiment around it — particularly with reference to the [Qt Documentation](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/).

## My first Window

So, lets get started by creating our very first windowed application. Before getting
the window on the screen, there are a few key concepts to introduce about how
applications are organised in the Qt world. If you're already familiar with event
loops you can safely skip to the next section.

### The Event loop and `QApplication`

The core of every Qt Applications is the `QApplication` class. Every application
needs one — and only one — `QApplication` object to function. This object holds
the *event loop* of your application — the core loop which governs all user 
interaction with the GUI.

Each interaction with your application — whether a press of a key, click of a mouse,
or mouse movement — generates an *event* which is placed on the *event queue*.
In the event loop, the queue is checked on each iteration and if a waiting event
is found, the event and control is passed to the specific *event handler* for the event. 
The event handler deals with the event, then passes control back to the event
loop to wait for more events. There is only *one* running event loop per 
application.


I> #### Key Points
I>
I> - QApplication holds the Qt event loop
I> - One QApplication instance required
I> - You application sits waiting in the event loop until an action is taken
I> - There is only *one* event loop


### Creating your App

So, lets create your first application! To start create a new Python file — you 
can call it whatever you like (e.g. `MyApp.py`).

W> ### Backup!
W>
W> We'll be editing within this file as we go along, and you may want to come
W> back to earlier versions of your code, so remember to keep regular backups
W> along the way. For example, after each section save a file named `MyApp_<section>.py`

The source code for your very first application is shown below. Type it in verbatim,
and be careful not to make mistakes. If you do mess up, Python should let you know
what's wrong when you run it. If you don't feel like typing it all in, you can 
[download the source code](http://download.martinfitzpatrick.name/create-simple-gui-applications/all_the_source.zip).

{pagebreak}

<<(code/creating_a_window_1.py)


Let's go through the code line by line. 

We start by importing the PyQt5 classes that we need for the application,
from the `QtWidgets`, `QtGui` and `QtCore` submodules.

I> This kind of global import `from <module> import *` is generally
I> frowned upon in Python. However, in this case we know that the 
I> PyQt classnames don't conflict with one another, or with Python itself.
I> Importing them all saves a lot of typing, and helps with PyQt4 compatibility.

Next we create an instance of `QApplication`, passing in `sys.arg` (which contains 
command line arguments). This allows us to pass command line arguments to our
application. If you know you won't be accepting command line arguments you can
pass in an empty list instead, e.g.

    app = QApplication([])

Finally, we call `app.exec_()` to start up the event loop.

I> The underscore is there because `exec` is a reserved word in Python and can’t
I> be used as a function name. PyQt5 handles this by appending an underscore to the 
I> name used in the C++ library. You'll also see it for `.print_()`.

So, lets launch your application. You can run it from the command line like any
other Python script, for example:

    python MyApp.py
    
Or, for Python 3:

    python3 MyApp.py

The application should run without errors, yet there will be no indication of 
anything happening, aside from perhaps a busy indicator. This is completely 
normal — we haven't told Qt to create a window yet!

Every application needs at least one `QMainWindow`, though you can have more
than one if you ned to. However, no matter how many you have, your application
will always exit when the last main window is closed.

Let's add a `QMainWindow` to our application.

<<(code/creating_a_window_2.py)

{pagebreak}

I> #### `QMainWindow`
I>
I> - Main focus for user of your application
I> - Every application needs at least one (...but can have more)
I> - Application will exit when last main window is closed

If you launch the application you should now
see your main window. Notice that Qt automatically creates a window with the normal
window decorations, and you can drag it around and resize it like any normal window.

E> #### I can't see my window!
E> 
E> You must *always* call  `.show()` on a newly created `QMainWindow` as they
E> are created invisible by default.

Congratulations — you've created your first Qt application! It's not very
interesting at the moment, so lets add some content to the window.

If you want to create a custom window, the best approach is to subclass 
`QMainWindow` and then include the setup for the window in the `__init__`
block. This allows the window behaviour to be self contained. So 
lets add our own subclass of `QMainWindow` — we can call it `MainWindow` to
keep things simple.

{pagebreak}

<<(code/creating_a_window_end.py)

Notice how we write the `__init__` block with a small bit of boilerplate to take
the arguments (none currently) and pass them up to the `__init__` of
the parent `QMainWindow` class.

I> When you subclass a Qt class you must *always* call the super
I> `__init__` function to allow Qt to set up the object.

Next we use `.setWindowTitle()` to change the title of our main window.

Then we add our first widget — a `QLabel` — to the middle of the window.
This is one of the simplest widgets available in Qt. You create the object
by passing in the text that you want the widget to display.

We set the alignment of the widget to the center, so it will show up inin
the middle of the window.


T> The Qt namespace (`Qt.`) is full of all sorts of attributes that you can use
T> to customise and control Qt widgets. We’ll cover that a bit more later,
T> [it’s worth a look](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html).

Finally, we call `.setCentralWidget()` on the the window. This is a
`QMainWindow` specific function that allows you to set the widget that
goes in the middle of the window.

If you launch your application you should see your window again, but this time
with the `QLabel` widget in the middle. 

I> #### Hungry for widgets?
I>
I> We'll cover more widgets in detail shortly
I> but if you're impatient and would like to jump ahead you can take a look at the
I> [QWidget documentation](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/widget-classes.html#basic-widget-classes). Try adding the different widgets to your window!


In this section we've covered the `QApplication` class, the `QMainWindow`
class, the event loop and experimented with adding a simple widget to a window. In the next
section we'll take a look at the mechanisms Qt provides for widgets and windows to 
communicate with one another and your own code.

G> Save a copy of your file as `MyApp_window.py` as we'll need it again later.


## Signals, Slots, Events

As already described, every interaction the user has with a Qt application causes
an Event. There are multiple types of event, each representing a difference
type of interaction — e.g. mouse or keyboard events.

Events that occur are passed to the event-specific handler on the widget where
the interaction occurred. For example, clicking on a widget will cause a
`QMouseEvent` to be sent to the `.mousePressEvent` event handler on the widget.
This handler can interrogate the event to find out information, such as 
what triggered the event and where specifically it occurred.

You can intercept events by subclassing and overriding the handler function on
the class, as you would for any other function. You can choose to filter,
modify, or ignore events, passing them through to the normal handler for 
the event by calling the parent class function with `super()`.

    class CustomButton(Qbutton)

        def keyPressEvent(self, e):
            # My custom event handling
            super(CustomButton, self).keyPressEvent(e)

However, imagine you want to catch an event on 20 different buttons. Subclassing
like this now becomes an incredibly tedious way of catching, interpreting
and handling these events.
    
    class CustomButton99(Qbutton)

        def keyPressEvent(self, e):
            # My custom event handling
            super(CustomButton99, self).keyPressEvent(e)

Thankfully Qt offers a neater approach to receiving notification of 
things happening in your application: *Signals*.


### Signals

Instead of intercepting raw events, signals allow you to 'listen' for
notifications of specific occurrences within your application. While
these can be similar to events — a click on a button — they can also
be more nuanced — updated text in a box. Data can also be sent 
alongside a signal - so as well as being notified of the updated text 
you can also receive it.

The receivers of signals are called *Slots* in Qt terminology. A number of
standard slots are provided on Qt classes to allow you to wire together
different parts of your application. However, you can also use any Python
function as a slot, and therefore receive the message yourself.

{icon=floppy-o}
G> Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_window.py` and save it under a new name for this section.

#### Basic signals

First, let's look at the signals available for our `QMainWindow`. You can
find this information in the [Qt documentation](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmainwindow.html).
Scroll down to the Signals section to see the signals implemented for 
this class. 

![Qt 5 Documentation — QMainWindow Signals](images/qtdoc-signals-qmainwindow.png)

As you can see, alongside the two `QMainWindow` signals, there are 
4 signals inherited from `QWidget` and 2 signals inherited from `Object`.
If you click through to the `QWidget` signal documentation you can see a
`.windowTitleChanged` signal implemented here. Next we'll demonstrate that
signal within our application. 

![Qt 5 Documentation — Widget Signals](images/qtdoc-signals-qwidget.png)


{pagebreak}

<<(code/signals_slots_and_events_1.py)

{pagebreak}

We start by creating an function that will behave as a ‘slot’ for our
signals.

Then we use .connect on the `.windowTitleChanged` signal. We pass the
function that we want to be called with the signal data. In this case
the signal sends a string, containing the new window title.

If we run that, we see that we receive the notification that the window
title has changed.

#### Customising signal data

As you find yourself using signals more often, you'll often find that
you want to be able to customise the data that is sent with them.
Unfortunately there is no way to do this in Qt directly, but we can 
exploit some features of Python to make it work for us.

To start with, lets see how to send less data. For example we’ll create
a function that accepts two parameters, with default values. However,
neither of these is a string. How can we connect our
`.windowTitleChanged` signal to this function?

We can do this by using a wrapper function, or a lambda. When the signal is
emitted this wrapper function will be called and can add or remove data
from the signal as required, before passing it on to the real slot.

So, for example, to discard data from a signal that emits a single value
we could use the following construction. 

    def wrapper_function(x):
        real_function()  # To call target, discarding x

Here the `wrapper_function` accepts the `x` value, but does not pass it when
calling `real_function`. We can also write this using a lambda as follows:

    lamba x: fn()

Just like the function, the lambda accepts a single parameter `x`, then discards it
calling the *real* target `fn` with no parameters:

T> It doesn't matter whether you use a normal function or `lambda`
T> (one-line function) for these. However, we use the lambda syntax here
T> because it makes for clearer code. For example, the following are
T> functionally identifical.

If we want to send *more* data we can use a similar construction, but 
instead of discarding a parameter we add another. For example:

    def wrapper_function(x)
        real_function(x, some_more_data)
        
Or again, with `lambda` syntax:

    lamba x: fn(x, some_more_data)

However, lets try that again with a loop. Here we’re going to use a
layout to create a list of widgets, don’t worry about that it’ll be
explained later.

You’ll notice that clicking on all of the widgets gives the same result?

So, what can we do? If we pass the extra data in as a named parameter to
the lambda, we create a new namespace and voila it works.

    lambda x, data=data: fn(x, data)


W> #### You *must* use named parameters
W>
W> Because of the way variables are bound in Python, if you just use the 
W> variable inside the lambda/function it will remain bound to the loop.
W> When any signal is triggered, that variable will equal the last value
W> it had in the loop.
W> However, when passing in as a named variable the value is bound directly
W> each time the function/lambda is defined, and each signal gets a different
W> value.

So, now you should be able to pass just about anything to any function
using signals! The final code now looks like this:

{pagebreak}

<<(code/signals_slots_and_events_2.py)

{pagebreak}

#### Custom Signals

The final bit of signals we’re going to cover is custom signals. These
allow you to use the Qt event loop to send data around your application.
It’s a great way to keep your app modular and responsive.

Signals must be defined on the class. You pass in the type that will be
sent with the signal when creating it. You can send any Python type,
including multiple types, and compound types (e.g. dictionaries, lists).

Then, you can connect and use your signal just as normal.


### Events

Next, let’s take a quick look at events. Thanks to signals, for most
purposes you can happily avoid using events in Qt, but it’s important
to understand how they work for when they are neccessary.

As an example, we're going to intercept the `.contextMenuEvent` on 
`QMainWindow`. This event is fired whenever a context menu is 
*about to be* shown, and is passed a single value `event` of type
`QContextMenuEvent`.

To intercept the event, we simply override the object method with our
new method of the same name. So in this case we can create a method
on our `MainWindow` subclass with the name `contextMenuEvent` and it
will receive all events of this type.

    def contextMenuEvent(self, event):
        print("Context menu event!")

If you add the above method to your `MainWindow` class and run your 
program you will discover that right-clicking in your window now
displays the message in the print statement.

Sometimes you may wish to intercept an event, yet still trigger 
the default (parent) event handler. You can do this by calling the
event handler on the parent class using `super` as normal for
Python class methods.

    def contextMenuEvent(self, event):
        print("Context menu event!")
        super(self, MainWindow).contextMenuEvent(event)

This allows you to propogate events up the object hierarchy, handling only
those parts of an event handler that you wish to.


However, in Qt there is another type of event hierarchy, constructed 
around the UI relationships. Widgets that are added to a layout, within 
another widget, may opt to pass their events to their UI parent. 
In complex widgets with multiple sub-elements this can allow for 
delegation of event handling to the containing widget for certain events.

However, if you have dealt with an event and do not want it
to propogate in this way you can flag this by calling .accept() on the event.

    class CustomButton(Qbutton)
    
        def event(self, e):
            e.accept()

Alternatively, if you do want it to propogate calling .ignore() will
achieve this.

    class CustomButton(Qbutton)
    
        def event(self, e):
            e.ignore()

In this section we've covered signals, slots and events. We've demonstrated
some simple signals, including how to pass less and more data using lambdas.
We've created custom signals, and shown how to intercept events, pass on
event handling and use `.accept()` and `.ignore()` to hide/show events
to the UI-parent widget. In the next section we will go on to take 
a look at two common features of the GUI — toolbars and menus.

{pagebreak}

## Actions, Toolbars and Menus

tbc.



### Actions

QAction
Customizable with labels, status tooltips, and icons
Provides .hovered, .triggered and .toggled signals
Can be added to toolbars and menus

{pagebreak}

### Toolbars

Toolbars are bars of icons and/or text used to perform common tasks within an
application, for which accessing via a menu would be cumbersome.
They are one of the most common UI features seen in many applications. While 
some complex applications, particularly in the Microsoft Office suite, have 
migrated to contextual 'ribbon' interfaces, the standard toolbar is usually 
sufficient for the majority of applications you will create.

![Standard GUI elements - The toolbar](images/toolbar.png)

Qt toolbars support display of icons, text, and can also contain any standard
Qt widget. However, for buttons the best approach is to make use of the 
QAction system to place buttons on the toolbar.


<<(code/toolbars_and_menus_1.py)

{pagebreak}


![Qt Documentation - Signals](images/qtdoc-signals.png)

You can also set whether to use icons, text or both on your toolbars, using
`.setToolButtonStyle`. This slot accepts any of the following flags from the `Qt.`
namespace:

| Flag                          | Behaviour                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Qt.ToolButtonIconOnly`       | Icon only, no text                        |
| `Qt.ToolButtonTextOnly`       | Text only, no icon                        |
| `Qt.ToolButtonTextBesideIcon` | Icon and text, with text beside the icon  |
| `Qt.ToolButtonTextUnderIcon`  | Icon and text, with text under the icon   |
| `Qt.ToolButtonIconOnly`       | Icon only, no text                        |
| `Qt.ToolButtonFollowStyle`    | Follow the host desktop style             |

The default value is `Qt.ToolButtonFollowStyle`, meaning that your application
will default to following the standard/global setting for the desktop on
which the application runs. This is generally recommended to make your 
application feel as *native* as possible.

## Widgets

In Qt (and most User Interfaces) ‘widget’ is the name given to a
component of the UI that the user can interact with. User interfaces are
made up of multiple widgets, arranged within the window.

Qt comes with a large selection of widgets available, and even allows
you to create your own custom and customised widgets.

{icon=floppy-o}
G> Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_window.py` and save it under a new name for this section.

### Big ol' list of widgets

A full list of widgets is available on the Qt documentation. But lets
have a look at them quickly.

{pagebreak}

<<(code/widgets_list.py)

{pagebreak}

To do this we’re going to take the skeleton of our application and
replace the `QLabel` with a `QWidget`. This is the generic form of a Qt
widget.

Here we’re not using it directly. We apply a list of widgets - in a
layout, which we will cover shortly - and then add the `QWidget` as the
central widget for the window. The result is that we fill the window
with widgets, with the `QWidget` acting as a container.

T> ### Compound widgets
T>
T> Note that it’s possible to use this `QWidget` layout trick to create
T> custom compound widgets. For example you can take a base `QWidget` and
T> overlay a layout containing multiple widgets of different types. This
T> 'widget' can then be inserted into other layouts as normal. We'll
T> cover custom widgets in more detail later.

Lets have a look at all the example widgets, from top to bottom:

| Widget            | What it does                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `QCheckbox`       | A checkbox                                | 
| `QComboBox`       | A dropdown list box                       |
| `QDateEdit`       | For editing dates and datetimes           |
| `QDateTimeEdit`   | For editing dates and datetimes           |
| `QDial`           | Rotateable dial                           |
| `QDoubleSpinbox`  | A number spinner for floats               |
| `QFontComboBox`   | A list of fonts                           |
| `QLCDNumber`      | A quite ugly LCD display                  |
| `QLabel`          | Just a label, not interactive             |
| `QLineEdit`       | Enter a line of text                      |
| `QProgressBar`    | A progress bar                            |
| `QPushButton`     | A button                                  |
| `QRadioButton`    | A toggle set, with only one active item   |
| `QSlider`         | A slider                                  |
| `QSpinBox`        | An integer spinner                        |
| `QTimeEdit`       | For editing times                         |

There are actually more widgets than this, but they don’t fit so well!
You can see them all by checking the documentation. Here we’re going to
take a closer look at the a subset of the most useful.

{pagebreak}

#### QLabel

We'll start the tour with `QLabel`, arguably one of the simplest widgets
available in the Qt toolbox. This is a simple one-line piece of text
that you can position in your application. You can set the text by 
passing in a str as you create it:

    widget = QLabel("Hello")

Or, by using the `.setText()` method:

    widget = QLabel("1") # The label is created with the text 1
    widget.setText("2")  # The label now shows 2
    
You can also adjust font parameters, such as the size of the font or
the alignment of text in the widget.

<<(code/widgets_1.py)

I> ## Font tips
I> 
I> Note that if you want to change the properties of a widget font it
I> is usually better to get the *current* font, update it and then 
I> apply it back. This ensures the font face remains in keeping with 
I> the desktop conventions.

The alignment is specified by using a flag from the `Qt.` namespace.
The flags available for horizontal alignment are:


| Flag              | Behaviour                                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Qt.AlignLeft`    | Aligns with the left edge.                    |
| `Qt.AlignRight`   | Aligns with the right edge.                   |
| `Qt.AlignHCenter` | Centers horizontally in the available space.  |
| `Qt.AlignJustify` | Justifies the text in the available space.    |

The flags available for vertical alignment are:

| Flag              | Behaviour                                     | 
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Qt.AlignTop`     | Aligns with the top.                          |
| `Qt.AlignBottom`  | Aligns with the bottom.                       |
| `Qt.AlignVCenter` | Centers vertically in the available space.    |


You can combine flags together using pipes (`|`), however note that you
can only use vertical or horizontal alignment flag at a time.


    align_top_left = Qt.AlignLeft | Qt.AlignTop

I> Qt Flags
I>
I> Note that you use an *OR* pipe (`|`) to combine the two flags (not `A & B`).
I> This is because the flags are non-overlapping bitmasks.
I> e.g. `Qt.AlignLeft` has the hexadecimal value `0x0001`, 
I> while `Qt.AlignBottom` is `0x0040`.
I> By ORing together we get the value `0x0041` representing 'bottom left'.
I> This principle applies to all other combinatorial Qt flags.
I>
I> If this is gibberish to you, feel free to ignore and move on.


Finally, there is also a shorthand flag that centers in both directions simultaneously:

| Flag              | Behaviour                                       |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Qt.AlignCenter`  | Centers horizontally *and* vertically           |


Weirdly, you can also use `QLabel` to display an image using `.setPixmap()`. 
This accepts an *pixmap*, which you can create by passing an image filename
to `QPixmap`. In the example files provided with this book you can find
a file `hrh.jpg` which you can display in your window as follows:

    widget.setPixMap(QPixmap('hrh.jpg'))
    

{pagebreak}

![HRH Queen Lizzy (by NASA/Bill Ingalls — Public domain.](images/hrh.jpg)

God Save the Queen. By default the image scales while maintaining its
aspect ratio. If you want it to stretch and scale to fit the window completely
you can set `.setScaledContents(True)` on the `QLabel`.


    widget.setScaledContents(True)


{pagebreak}

#### QCheckBox

The next widget to look at is `QCheckBox()` which, as the name suggests, presents a
checkable box to the user. However, as with all Qt widgets there are number of
configurable options to change the widget behaviours.

<<(code/widgets_3.py)

You can set a checkbox state programmatically using `.setChecked` or `.setCheckState`.
The former accepts either `True` or `False` representing checked or unchecked respectively.
However, with `.setCheckState` you also specify a particially checked state using a
`Qt.` namespace flag:

| Flag                  | Behaviour                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Qt.Unchecked`        | Item is unchecked                               |
| `Qt.PartiallyChecked` | Item is partially checked                       |
| `Qt.Checked`          | Item is unchecked                               |

A checkbox that supports a partially-checked (`Qt.PartiallyChecked`) state is
commonly referred to as 'tri-state', that is being neither on nor off. A checkbox
in this state is commonly shown as a greyed out checkbox, and is commonly used in
hierachical checkbox arrangements where sub-items are linked to parent checkboxes.

If you set the value to `Qt.PartiallyChecked` the checkbox will become
tristate. You can also `.setTriState(True)` to set tristate support on a
You can also set a checkbox to be tri-state without setting the current state to
partially checked by using `.setTriState(True)` 

T> You may notice that when the script is running the current state number is displayed 
T> as an `int` with checked = `2`, unchecked = `0`, and partially 
T> checked = `1`. You don’t need to remember these values, the `Qt.Checked` namespace
T> variable `== 2` for example. This is the value of these state's respective flags.
T> This means you can test state using `state == Qt.Checked`.

#### QComboBox

The `QComboBox` is a drop down list, closed by default with an arrow to open it.
You can select a single item from the list, with the currently selected item being
shown as a label on the widget. The combo box is suited to selection of a choice
from a long list of options. 

I> You have probably seen the combo box used for selection of 
I> font faces, or size, in word processing applications. Although Qt actually provides
I> a specific font-selection combo box as `QFontComboBox`. 

You can add items to a `QComboBox` by passing a list of strings to `.addItems()`. 
Items will be added in the order they are provided. 

<<(code/widgets_4.py)

The `.currentIndexChanged` signal is triggered when the currently selected item
is updated, by default passing the index of the selected item in the list.
However, when connecting to the signal you can also request an alternative version
of the signal by appending `[str]` (think of the signal as a `dict`). This alternative
interface instead provides the label of the currently selected item, which is often
more useful.

`QComboBox` can also be editable, allowing users to enter values not currently in the list
and either have them inserted, or simply used as a value. To make the box editable:

    widget.setEditable(True)

You can also set a flag to determine how the insert is handled. These flags are stored
on the `QComboBox` class itself and are listed below:


| Flag                              | Behaviour                                  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `QComboBox.NoInsert`              | No insert                                  |
| `QComboBox.InsertAtTop`           | Insert as first item                       |
| `QComboBox.InsertAtCurrent`       | Replace currently selected item            |
| `QComboBox.InsertAtBottom`        | Insert after last item                     |
| `QComboBox.InsertAfterCurrent`    | Insert after current item                  |
| `QComboBox.InsertBeforeCurrent`   | Insert before current item                 |
| `QComboBox.InsertAlphabetically`  | Insert in alphabetical order               |

To use these, apply the flag as follows:

    widget.setInsertPolicy(QComboBox.InsertAlphabetically)

You can also limit the number of items allowed in the box by using `.setMaxCount`, e.g.

    widget.setMaxCount(10)

{pagebreak}

#### QListBox

Next `QListBox`. It’s very similar to `QComboBox`, differing mainly in the
signals available.

<<(code/widgets_5.py)

`QListBox` offers an `currentItemChanged` signal which sends the `QListItem`
(the element of the list box), and a `currentTextChanged` signal which
sends the text.

{pagebreak}

#### QLineEdit

The `QLineEdit` widget is a simple single-line text editing box, into
which users can type input. These are used for form fields, or settings
where there is no restricted list of valid inputs. For example, when
entering an email address, or computer name.

<<(code/widgets_6.py)

You can set a maximum length for the text with `.setMaxLength`.

You can add placeholder text to be shown when nothing is entered.

You can also set the text box to be read only, so it cannot be edited.

There is a signal to detect when return has been pressed, when the text
selection has changed.

For when the text in the box has been edited and when it has been
changed. The distinction here is between user edits and programmatic
changes. The `textEdited` signal is only sent when the user edits text. —

Validation of input strings can be performed automatically by using 
an *input mask* which you apply to the field.

{pagebreak}

#### QSpinBox

`QSpinBox` provides a small numerical input box with arrows to increase
and decrease the value. `QSpinBox` supports integers.

<<(code/widgets_7.py)


You can set the range using `setMinimum` and `setMaximum`, or `setRange` to
set both simultaneously.

Prefixes and suffixes can be added to the number, for example currency
markers or units.

The size of the step determines how much the value increases or
decreases for each arrow button click.

A valueChanged signal emits the current value whenever it updates.

A string version of this same signal sends the value, but as a string
including the prefix and suffix.

The related widget, `QDoubleSpinBox`, is basically identical, except 
that is supports floats.


{pagebreak}

#### QSlider

`QSlider` provides a slide-bar widget, which functions internally much 
like a `QDoubleSpinBox`. Rather than display the current value numerically,
it is represented by the position of the slider
handle along the length of the widget. This is often useful when providing
adjustment between two extremes, but where absolutel accuracy is not required.
The most common use of this type of widget is for volume controls.

There is an additional `.sliderMoved` signal that is triggered whenever the
slider moves position and a `.sliderPressed` signal that emits whenever the
slider is clicked.

<<(code/widgets_8.py)

You can also construct a slider with a vertical or horizontal orientation by 
passing the orientation in as you create it. The orientiation flags are
defined in the `Qt.` namespace. For example: 

    widget.QSlider(Qt.Vertical)
    
Or:
    
    widget.QSlider(Qt.Horizontal)


{pagebreak}

#### QDial

Finally, the `QDial` is a rotateable widget that functions just like the
slider, but appears as an analogue dial. This looks nice, but from a UI
perspective is not particularly userfriendly. However, they are often
used in audio applications as representation of real-world analogue dials.

<<(code/widgets_9.py)




That is the conclusions of this brief tour through the Qt widgets available in
PyQt. To see the full list of available widgets and their signals and
attributes, take a look at the [Qt documentation](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/).


## Layouts

So far we've successfully created a window, and we've added a widget to it. However
we normally want to add more than one widget to a window, and have some control over 
where it ends up. To do this in Qt we use *layouts*. There are 4 basic layouts 
available in Qt, which are listed in the following table. 

| Layout                            | Behaviour                               |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `QHBoxLayout`                     | Linear horizontal layout                |
| `QVBoxLayout`                     | Linear vertical layout                  |
| `QGridLayout`                     | In indexable grid XxY                   |
| `QStackedLayout`                  | Stacked (z) in front of one another     |


T> #### Qt Designer
T> 
T> You can actually design and lay out your interface graphically using the Qt
T> designer, which we will cover later. Here we're using code, as it's simpler
T> to understand and experiment with the underlying system.

As you can see, there are three positional layouts available in Qt. The `VBoxLayout`,
`QHBoxLayout` and `QGridLayout`. In addition there is also `QStackedLayout` which 
allows you to place widgets one on top of the other within the same space, yet
showing only one layout at a time.

{icon=floppy-o}
G> Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_window.py` and save it under a new name for this section.

Before we start experimenting with the different layouts, we're first going to 
create a very simple custom widget that we can use to visualise the layouts 
that we use. Add the following code to your file as a new class at the top level:

<<(code/layout_colorwidget.py)

In this code we subclass `QWdiget` to create our own custom widget `Color`. We accept a
single parameter when creating the widget — `color` (a `str`). We first set
`.setAutoFillBackground` to `True` to tell the widget to automatically fill it's background
with the window color. Next we get the current palette (which is the global desktop palette
by default) and change the current `QPalette.Window` color to a new `QColor` described
by the value `color` we passed in. Finally we apply this palette back to the widget. The
end result is a widget that is filled with a solid color, that we specified when we
created it.

If you find the above confusing, don't worry too much. We'll cover custom widgets in 
more detail later. For now it's sufficient that you understand that calling you
can create a solid-filled red widget by doing the following:

    Color('red')

We'll look at each of the available layouts in turn.

### `QVBoxLayout` vertically arranged widgets

With `QVBoxLayout` you arrange widgets one above the other linearly.
Adding a widget adds it to the bottom of the column.


![A QVBoxLayout, filled from top to bottom.](images/vboxlayout.png)

### `QHBoxLayout` horizontally arranged widgets


`QHBoxLayout` is the same, except moving horizontally. Adding a widget
adds it to the right hand side.

![A QHBoxLayout, filled from left to right.](images/hboxlayout.png)

### `QGridLayout` widgets arranged in a grid


`QGridLayout` allows you to specify using row,column indices where to
place the widget.

![A QGridLayout showing the grid positions for each location.](images/gridlayout1.png)

Usefully, for `QGridLayout` you don't need to fill all the positions in the grid.

![A QGridLayout with unfilled slots.](images/gridlayout2.png)

### `QStackedLayout` multiple widgets in the same space

Finally, `QStackedLayout` allows you to place widgets one in front of the
other. You could use this for drawing layers in a graphics application,
or for imitating a tab-like interface. Note there is also `QStackedWidget`
which is a container widget that works in exactly the same way. This is
useful if you want to add a stack directly to a `QMainWindow` with
`.setCentralWidget`.

![QStackedLayout — in use only the uppermost widget is visible, which is by default the first widget added to the layout.](images/qstackedlayout1.png)

![QStackedLayout, with the 2nd (1) widget selected and brought to the front ](images/qstackedlayout2.png)


To demonstrate this we’re going to create a custom widget, with a solid
color background. Don’t worry about this for now, it’s just for
demonstration purposes.


{icon=floppy-o}
G> Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_window.py` and save it under a new name for this section.


{pagebreak}

<<(code/layout_1.py)

{pagebreak}

Once it’s complete we add it to the mainwindow using `.setCentralWidget`
and we get a solid red window.

So lets add some things to a `QVBoxLayout`. We still need to add a widget
to the mainwindow so we create a empty `QWidget` and set the layout on
that. Our coloured widgets will arrange themselves in the layout,
contained within the `QWidget` in the window.

First lets just add the red widget again.

{pagebreak}

<<(code/layout_2.py)

{pagebreak}

Notice the border, this is the layout spacing.

We can add two more colours.

As we add widgets they line themselves up vertically in the order they
are added.

If we change the `QVBoxLayout` to a `QHBoxLayout` the boxes now flow left to
right.

    layout = QHBoxLayout()

You can nest widgets inside one another using addLayout. Let’s add a
`QVBoxLayout` into the main `QHBoxLayout`. If we add some widgets to the
`QVBoxLayout`, they’ll be arranged vertically in the first slot of the
parent layout.

{pagebreak}

<<(code/layout_4.py)

{pagebreak}

You can set the spacing around the layout using `.setContentMargins`.

…or set the spacing between elements using `.setSpacing`.

    layout1.setContentsMargins(0,0,0,0)
    layout1.setSpacing(20)

As useful as they are, if you try and using `QVBoxLayout` and `QHBoxLayout` for
laying out multiple elements, e.g. for a form, you’ll find it very
difficult to ensure differently sized widgets line up. The solution to
this is `QGridLayout`.

`QGridLayout` allows you to position items specifically in a grid. You
specify row and column positions for each widget. You can skip elements,
and they will be left empty.

{pagebreak}

<<(code/layout_6.py)

{pagebreak}

—

The final layout we’ll cover is the `QStackedLayout`. As described, this
layout allows you to position elements directly in front of one another.
You can then select which widget you want to show.

{pagebreak}

<<(code/layout_7.py)

{pagebreak}

This is exactly how tabbed views work - only one view (‘tab’) is show at
any one time.

You can add elements to a `QStackedLayout` as normal. By default the
latest-added widget is shown.

You can choose to show another widget by calling `.setCurrentIndex()` or
`.setCurrentWidget()`.

I’m going to create a quick demo to show how you could use
`QStackedLayout` to provide a tab-like interface.

{pagebreak}

<<(code/layout_8.py)

{pagebreak}

But… helpfully. Qt actually provide a built-in TabWidget that provides
this kind of layout out of the box - albeit in widget form.

I’ll re-create the demo using `QTabWidget` and demonstrate some features.

{pagebreak}

<<(code/layout_9.py)

{pagebreak}


So that’s it!

In this lesson we introduced the 3 main classes of positional layouts
`QHBoxLayout`, `QVBoxLayout`, `QGridLayout` and the special layout
`QStackedLayout`. Until next time!

{pagebreak}

## Dialogs

Dialogs are useful GUI components that allow you to *communicate* with the user (hence
the name dialog). They are commonly used for file Open/Save, settings, preferences, 
or for functions that do not fit into the main UI of the application. They are small 
modal (or *blocking*) windows that sit in front of the main application until they are 
dismissed.  Qt actually provides a number of 'special' dialogs for the most common
use-cases, allowing you to take advantage of desktop-specific tools for a better
user experience.

{icon=floppy-o}
G> Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_menus.py` and save it under a new name for this section.

![Standard GUI features — A search dialog](images/dialog-find.png)

![Standard GUI features — A file Open dialog](images/dialog-open.png)

In Qt dialog boxes are handled by the `QDialog` class. To create a new dialog
box simply create a new object of `QDialog` type (or a subclass), passing in 
a parent widget, e.g. `QMainWindow`, as its parent.

{icon=floppy-o}
G> Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_menus.py` and save it under a new name for this section.

Let's create our own `QDialog`, we'll use our menu example code so we can start a dialog
window when a button on the toolbar is pressed.

<<(code/dialog_1.py)

In the triggered function (that receives the signal from the button )
we create the dialog instance, passing our `QMainWindow` instance as a
parent. This will make the dialog a *modal window* of `QMainWindow`. This means the
dialog will completely block interaction with the parent window.

Once we have created the dialog, we start it using `.exec_()` - just like we did for 
`QApplication` to create the main event loop of our application. That’s not a coincidence:
when you exec the `QDialog` an entirely new event loop - specific for the dialog - is created. 

I> One event loop to rule them all
I>
I> Remember I said there can only be one Qt event loop running at any time? 
I> I meant it! The `QDialog` completely blocks your application execution.
I> Don't start a dialog and expect anything else to happen anywhere else in your application.
I> 
I> We'll cover how you can use multithreading to get you out of this pickle in a later chapter.

{icon=rocket}
G> #### Run it!
G>
G> The window will display, now click the bug button and a modal
G> window should appear. You can exit by clicking the [x].

Like our very first window, this isn't very interesting. Let's fix that by 
adding a dialog title and a set of OK and Cancel buttons to allow the user to *accept* 
or *reject* the modal.

To customise the `QDialog` we can subclass it — again you *can* customise the dialog
without subclassing, but it's nicer if you do. 

<<(code/dialog_2.py)

In the above code, we first create our subclass of `QDialog` which we've called `CustomDialog`.
As for the `QMainWindow` we customise it within the `__init__` block to ensure that our
customisations are created as the object is created. First we set a title for the `QDialog` using
`.setWindowTitle()`, exactly the same as we did for our main window.

The next block of code is concerned with creating and displaying the dialog buttons. This
is probably a bit more involved than you were expecting. However, this is due to Qt's flexibility
in handling dialog button positioning on different platforms.

I> #### Easy way out?
I>
I> You could of course choose to ignore this and use a standard `QButton` in a layout, but the approach
I> outlined here ensures that your dialog respects the host desktop standards
I> (Ok on left vs. right for example). Messing around with these behaviours 
I> can be incredibly annoying to your users, so I wouldn't recommend it.

The first step in creating a dialog button box is to define the buttons want to show,
using  namespace attributes from `QDialogButtonBox`. Constructing a line of multiple buttons is 
as simple as ORing them together using a pipe (`|`). The full list of buttons available 
is below:


| Layout                               |
|--------------------------------------|
| `QDialogButtonBox.Ok`                |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Open`              |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Save`              |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Cancel`            |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Close`             |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Discard`           |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Apply`             |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Reset`             |
| `QDialogButtonBox.RestoreDefaults`   |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Help`              |
| `QDialogButtonBox.SaveAll`           |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Yes`               |
| `QDialogButtonBox.YesToAll`          |
| `QDialogButtonBox.No`                |
| `QDialogButtonBox.NoToAll`           |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Abort`             |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Retry`             |
| `QDialogButtonBox.Ignore`            |
| `QDialogButtonBox.NoButton`          |


These should be sufficient to create any dialog box you can think of. For example, to show an
OK and a Cancel button we used:

    buttons = QDialogButtonBox.Ok | QDialogButtonBox.Cancel
    
The variable `buttons` now contains a bitmask flag representing those two buttons. Next,
we must create the `QDialogButtonBox` instance to hold the buttons. The flag for the 
buttons to display is passed in as the first parameter.

To make the buttons have any effect, you must connect the correct 
`QDialogButtonBox` signals to the slots on the dialog. In our case we've connected the
`.accepted` and `.rejected` signals from  the `QDialogButtonBox` to the handlers for 
`.accept()` and `.reject()` on  our subclass of `QDialog`.

Lastly, to make the `QDialogButtonBox` appear in our dialog box we must add it to the 
dialog layout. So, as for the main window we create a layout, and add our `QDialogButtonBox`
to it (`QDialogButtonBox` is a widget), and then set that layout on our dialog.

{icon=rocket}
G> #### Run it!
G>
G> Click to launch the dialog and you will see a dialog box with buttons in it.

Congratulations! You've created your first dialog box. Of course, you can continue to 
add any other content to the dialog box that you like. Simply insert it into the 
layout as normal.
