Welcome to *Creating Simple GUI Applications* where we will discover how
to use Python and Qt to do just that.

If you want to learn how to write GUI applications it
can be pretty tricky to get started. There are a lot of new concepts 
you need to understand to get *anything* to work. A lot of tutorials offer
nothing but screencasts, or short code snippets without any explanation
of the underlying systems and how they work together. But, like any code,
writing GUI applications requires you to learn to think about the problem
in the right way.

In this book I will give you the real useful basics that you need to get
building functional applications with the PyQt framework.  I’ll include explanations, 
diagrams, walkthroughs and code to make sure you know what you’re doing every step of 
the way. 

In no time at all you will have a fully functional Qt application - 
ready to customise as you like.

The source code for each step is included, but don't just copy and paste and move on.
You will learn much more if you experiment along the way!

So, lets get started!
